The Challenge
=============

Hopps is a simple document history-preserving key-value store built on
top of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and
[Python](https://www.python.org).

Your task, should you chose to accept it, is to document the Hopps API
and structure.

Goals
=====

Fill in the file ``docs.txt`` with documentation covering ``hopps.py``.
Use your best judgment! It is deliberately vague and slim.

Setup
=====

To work with Hopps, you will need Python 3.4 or later. On OS X and
Windows, use the installer from
[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you should set up a virtual environment. From within this
repository, run:

    pyvenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install tornado motor docopt typing

Ensure that you have MongoDB 3.2 or later installed from the
[MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).

Start a MongoDB instance:

    mkdir data
    mongod --dbpath=`pwd`/data --logpath mongod.log --fork

``sample.py`` demonstrates use of ``hopps.py``, and ``cli.py`` provides
a simple prompt interface for saving and retrieving documents.

Start Hopps:

    ./sample.py

And in a new terminal, run the following:

    ./cli.py
    help

Usage
=====

Once you have started an instance and started the CLI tool, you can begin to
issue commands. For example, run the following command:

    save foo '{"_id": "ff36cf3a-fd3b-431e-863e-5dc89d4f075e", "name": "Bob", "n": 42}'

This will save a document into the `foo` collection. Nothing will be printed
until you press return a second time.

To retrieve the document, run the following command and again press return:

    get foo ff36cf3a-fd3b-431e-863e-5dc89d4f075e

Project Anatomy
===============

Hopps has the following dependencies:

* docopt: A command line option parsing library.
* tornado: A web server library.
* motor/pymongo: A pair of libraries for communicating with MongoDB.

You should not need to be closely familiar with any these libraries to complete
the challenge.

* docs.txt: Documentation. You'll be writing in here.
* hopps.py: The core Hopps library.
* sample.py: A sample consumer of the Hopps library implementing a server.
* cli.py: A command line interface that communicates with the server
  started by sample.py.
